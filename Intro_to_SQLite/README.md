# Intro to SQLite

This notebook is adapted from [one](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tdmdal/mma-sql/blob/master/docs/SQL_Intro_Sqlite.ipynb) which appears to be part of a [SQL workshop](https://tdmdal.github.io/mma-sql/index.html) offered by the Rotman Research Node 
at the University of Toronto. It uses the [Northwind Traders](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Database_Examples/Northwind) database.

I am not the author of this notebook, but I have made very significant additions (to the SQL code) and improvements (to the formatting and documetation) throughout. The notebook is easiest to view in Colab, which requires a Google account.
